## Q1: How did I come up with this project?

I basically followed along a course online to be able to create this project with the help of the instructor of that course.

## Q2: What did I learn and practice here in this project?

To indicate to some of it I would say that I **learned** and **practice**:

- Spliting UI components into smaller components by considering logical separation, reusebility, and complexity.
- Component categories - stateless/presentational, stateful, structural -
- **Prop drilling** and its challenges
- Component composition that leads to flexible components and one of the possible to **prop drilling** problem.

**Note**: Please note that I have not been able to bring everything that I learned and practiced in detail here in this document because I think that it stretches out of this context and your tolerance, but you are free and welcome to take look at the project yourself. Also I wrote some comments in the project itself that explains and indicate to some important things that I learned and practiced along the way.
